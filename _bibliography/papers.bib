 abstract = {Neurons in the retrohippocampal cortices play crucial roles in spatial
memory. Many retrohippocampal neu-rons have firing fields that are
selectively active at specific locations, with memory for rewarded
locations associated with reorganization of these firing fields. Whether
this is the sole strategy for representing spatial memories is unclear.
Here, we demonstrate that during a spatial memory task retrohippocampal
neurons encode location through ramping activity that extends across
segments of a linear track approaching and following a reward, with the
rewarded location represented by offsets or switches in the slope of the
ramping activity. Ramping representations could be maintained
independently of trial outcome and cues marking the reward location,
indicating that they result from recall of the track structure. When
recorded in an open arena, neurons that generated ramping activity
during the spatial memory task were more numerous than grid or border
cells, with a majority showing spatial firing that did not meet criteria
for classification as grid or border representations. Encoding of
rewarded locations through offsets and switches in the slope of ramping
activ-ity also emerged in recurrent neural network models trained to
solve a similar spatial memory task. Impaired performance of model
networks following disruption of outputs from ramping neurons is
consistent with this coding strategy supporting navigation to recalled
locations of behavioral significance. Our results suggest that encoding
of learned spaces by retrohippocampal networks employs both discrete
firing fields and continuous ramping representations. We hypothesize
that retrohippocampal ramping activity mediates readout of learned
models for goal-directed navigation.},
