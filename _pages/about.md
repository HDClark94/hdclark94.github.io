Hi, I'm a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh working with Professor Matt Nolan to better understand spatial cognition through a combination of in-vivo electrophyisology and computational modelling approaches.
More broadly, I am interested in how the brain forges meaningful representations of the physical world to guide meaningful actions in the world.
